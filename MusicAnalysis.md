Fresh off of an absolutely stunning Coldplay concert, I was curious to determine if certain songs and/or particular types of music are more likely to be enjoyed by the public and have success on music streaming services.

# 1. Background Information

### 1.0 The Setting

In order to discover if certain genres and songs are generally more favorable, or if music is truly subjective, we can analyze a dataset that contains information about the top perfoming songs on the streaming service Spotify.

### 1.1 Guiding Questions 

1. What are some reoccuring characteristics of songs, such as the BPM, genre and key that are in the top 100?
2. How can understanding of these trends help aspiring musicians create music more likely to be well recepted by the public?

### Business Task

*Analyze data containing information on the top 100 songs of 2023 to understand listning preferences and provide artists with data-driven suggestions for music curation targeted for the general public*


# 2. The Data

### 2.0 Accessibility

The dataset is available to the public for download on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023)

2. Each row describes a song that was popular in the year 2023
3. Each column denotes different attributes of a particular song, including the presence and rank of the song on Spotify charts, BPM, Key and other metrics such as dancibility and energy percentage
